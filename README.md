# Doppler Radar Based Life Detection System

This project aimed at designing a low-cost Doppler radar system capable of detectin earthquake victims buried under rubble. The original system started with a cheap HB-100 system (located in ScienceFair2016), but after a summer's worth of research a from-scratch system was redesigned, requiring electrical and software innovation. The radar features a front-end clutter cancellation system which enables it to ignore the strong frontal reflections, allowing it to have hypersensitivity to signals through the rubble. Current work lies with redesigning the system on a printed circuit board for mobile deployment.
